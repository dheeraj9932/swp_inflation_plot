# 💸 Inflation & SWP Plotter 📈

Ever wondered how your investments will look after years of withdrawing monthly income *and* dealing with inflation? This interactive app lets you visualize exactly that—*and even lets you save the results!*

## 🔍 What This App Does

This tool helps you simulate:

- How **inflation eats into your corpus** over time.

All of this with a beautiful Plotly plot + an option to save the image locally.
